# OpenDucky
Script language and IDE for an open source Rubber Ducky

### Arduino compatible
Compatible with any attiny chip board like the Digispark, porting to Arduino boards is TODO

### Easy
There are only 6 commands

### Hackable
I mean it's open source so...

### I really suck at readmes
...


## Commands

- PRN: print e.g.: PRN hello

- PRL: print line

- SLP: sleep (miliseconds) e.g.: SLP 1000

- KST: keystroke e.g.: KST F12, KST SPACE

- FUN: function, use with [SHIFT, CONTROL, ALT, GUI]

- SPD: speed, set the default wait time after every command, 0 by default, n * 500ms otherwise
